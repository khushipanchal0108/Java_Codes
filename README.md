PART I: INPUTS USING DIFFERENT METHODS

This Java console application demonstrates various methods for reading user input and calculating the factorial of a number. It showcases different Java classes for input handling and includes a utility class for performing the calculation.

Classes Overview:
ScannerClass: Uses the Scanner class to read an integer from the console and calculate its factorial.
ConsoleLogInput: Utilizes the Console class for reading user input, including sensitive data like passwords, and calculates the factorial of a number.
CommandLine: Demonstrates using command-line arguments to perform factorial calculations.
BufferReader: Implements BufferedReader and InputStreamReader to read text input from the console for factorial calculation.
InputStream: Attempts to use InputStream for input handling, but conceptually requires correction for functionality.
Factorial: Contains the logic for calculating the factorial of a number, used across different input methods.

The application provides a practical exploration of Java's input handling mechanisms, offering a varied approach to receiving and processing user input for a common mathematical operation. It serves as an educational tool for understanding basic input/output operations in Java.

PART II: CALCULATOR

This repository contains a Java console application for performing simple math calculations. It includes classes for input handling, performing calculations, and managing the application flow.

This Java application calculates various mathematical operations based on user input. It consists of classes for input collection, calculation, and application flow management.

Classes:
Input: Uses Scanner to prompt for and read two numbers, returning them as a double array.

inputNumbers(): Reads two numbers from the user and returns them.
Calculator: Performs math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, power, mean, and variance.

Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with zero-division check), sqrt, power, mean, and variance, handling appropriate calculations and edge cases.
Main: The application's entry point, managing the flow and performing calculations based on user input.

Displays a menu, reads choices, performs calculations using Calculator, and displays results, looping until exit.

The application is designed for ease of use, with clear prompts and immediate feedback on calculations.
