This Java application is designed to identify two adjacent numbers within an array that have the minimal distance between them. The program is structured into three main classes:

Main Class:
Acts as the program's initiation point. It gathers input from the user, calculates the index of the initial number that has the least distance to its adjacent number, and outputs the findings.

NearestNeighbors Class:
Encapsulates the algorithm for pinpointing two adjacent numbers in an array with the minimum distance. It offers the findNearest() method, which accepts an array of integers and returns the index of the number that is closest to its neighbor.

UserInput Class:
Manages the acquisition of input from the user. It features the takeInput() method, which prompts the user to specify the array's size and its elements, subsequently returning an array populated with the numbers provided by the user.
