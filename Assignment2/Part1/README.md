This Java application is designed to segregate even and odd integers from a specified list of numbers. It is structured into two distinct classes:

Part1_evenodd.java: Houses the main method necessary for the program's execution. It gathers user inputs, segregates the numbers into even and odd categories, and then displays them accordingly.

Input.java: Offers a method named takeInput() for collecting integer arrays as input directly from the user.

Running the Program:
To launch the application:

Compile both Part1_evenodd.java and Input.java files.
Run the Part1_evenodd class, which acts as the program's starting point.
